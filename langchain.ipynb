       "'Mumbai\\'s temperature varies significantly depending on the time of year:\\n\\n*   **Winter (November to February):** The average temperature ranges from 22°C to 30°C (72°F to 86°F). It can sometimes dip to around 15°C (59°F) on cooler nights.\\n*   **Summer (March to May):** This is the hottest period, with average temperatures between 30°C to 35°C (86°F to 95°F). However, temperatures can often exceed 40°C (104°F).\\n*   **Monsoon (June to September):** The temperature during the monsoon season is usually between 27°C to 32°C (81°F to 90°F). The humidity is very high, making it feel hotter than the actual temperature.\\n*   **Post-Monsoon (October):** The temperature starts to decrease, with average temperatures ranging from 30°C to 35°C (86°F to 95°F). The humidity is still relatively high.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, there isn\\'t one \"normal\" temperature for Mumbai. It depends on the season.'"
